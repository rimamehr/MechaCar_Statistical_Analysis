## Linear Regression to Predict MPG 

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

 -- As seen in our output image below Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg value. In other words these variables have a
    significant impact on mpg value. The two variables that had the most amount of random variance to our mpg values are ground_clearance and vehicle_length.
